usage: git fork new <source> [<destination>] [-o <origin>] [-q|--quiet]

Arguments:
  <source>        Cloneable URI of the repo you wish to fork.
  <destination>   Directory to clone the fork to.
                  Defaults to the current directory.

Options:
  -o <origin>     URI of a remote to host your fork at.
  -q | --quiet    Suppresses output.

USAGE
}

help() {
  usage; cat <<HELP
Makes a new fork of a <source> repository.

The <source> remote is named as such under the assumption you will be pushing
contributions to a different remote that you have ownership of.

Like git-clone, you can provide an optional <destination> to fork to.
Otherwise, the fork is built in your current directory, in a directory
named after the repository.

An <origin> you have ownership of may be supplied with the -o flag.

Integration with GitHub forks is under dev.
