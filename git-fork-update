usage: git fork update [<branch_names>...] [-A|--all] [-q|--quiet]

Arguments:
  <branch_names>  List of branches to rebase off of master

Options:
  -A | -all       Updates all branches.
  -q | --quiet    Suppresses output.

USAGE
}

help() {
  usage; cat <<HELP
Updates local master from source/master.

If <branch_names> are supplied, each branch is rebased off of the fresh master.
All branches can be updated, but this is not reccommended as your clone may
have inherited other non-contribution branches in the initial cloning.

A mechanism for only updating branches that don't exist in source is under dev.
