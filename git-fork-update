usage: git fork update [-A|--all | -L|--local | <branch_names>...] [-q|--quiet]

Arguments:
  <branch_names>  List of branches to rebase off of master.
                  Defaults to the current branch if not on master.

Options:
  -A | -all       Updates all branches.
  -L | -local     Updates all branches that only exist locally.
  -q | --quiet    Suppresses output.

USAGE
}

help() {
  usage; cat <<HELP
Updates local master from source/master.

If <branch_names> are supplied, each branch is rebased off of the fresh master.
You can also instead update all branches that only exist locally (+ master),
or every branch.
